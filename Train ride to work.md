# DETECTIVE JOHN THORNE: THE DORMANT CONVERGENCE

The 6:15 southbound rattled through the tunnel, its gentle sway familiar to the morning commuters of New Manhattan. Detective John Thorne stood among them, one hand gripping the worn leather strap hanging from the ceiling, the other holding an actual paper file. The passengers around him scrolled through invisible text and images, their eyes flickering with the blue-white glow of neural feeds.

No one looked at anyone else. No one needed to.

Except Thorne.

He noticed the woman three stops in. Mid-thirties, expensively dressed, standing perfectly still despite the train's movement. Her enhancement indicator glowed the standard green at her temple, but her eyes were wrong. The pupils had contracted to pinpoints, despite the dimness of the train car.

More concerning was how they didn't move. Not a flicker, not a twitch. Just fixed straight ahead while the subtle glow of her neural interface reflected across her corneas.

Thorne had seen something similar only twice before. Both cases remained unsolved.

The train slowed for Morris Heights station. As the brakes engaged, the woman's head tilted precisely five degrees to the right. Her hand, previously gripping the rail with white knuckles, relaxed. Then her pupils dilated suddenly, expanding so wide the irises nearly disappeared.

No one else noticed. Why would they? The physical world had become secondary to the universe behind their eyes.

Thorne slipped the case file into his jacket and moved closer to her, maintaining the practiced nonchalance of a veteran detective. The train doors opened. A few passengers shuffled out, a few more shuffled in. The woman remained motionless.

"Excuse me," Thorne said quietly. "Are you alright?"

No response. Her enhancement indicator continued pulsing a steady green, reporting that all systems were functioning normally. But Thorne knew better.

"Ma'am?" he tried again, not reaching out, not yet. "I'm Detective Thorne, NMPD."

The train pulled away from the station. As it accelerated, the woman's body swayed naturally with the motion, but her eyes remained fixed—those too-wide pupils staring at something beyond the physical space around her.

Then she blinked. Once. Twice. Her pupils contracted to normal size.

"Yes?" she said, looking at him with mild annoyance. "Can I help you?"

"You seemed..." Thorne chose his words carefully. "Disconnected for a moment."

She frowned. "I'm fine. Just reviewing presentation data." She tapped her enhancement indicator as if that explained everything. Perhaps to anyone else, it would have.

"For approximately ninety seconds, you were non-responsive," Thorne said. "Your pupils were fully dilated in direct light."

The woman's expression shifted from annoyance to discomfort. "That's not possible. My neural activity log shows continuous normal function from home to—" She stopped mid-sentence, her brow furrowing. "Who did you say you were?"

Thorne produced his badge—an actual metal shield in a leather wallet, deliberately analog in a world where such identifications were typically exchanged wirelessly between enhancements.

"You're unenhanced," she said, her voice dropping to a whisper, as if mentioning a shameful condition.

"Yes."

"So you can't verify what you think you saw." Her shoulders relaxed slightly. "Neural interfaces often create visual processing artifacts for unenhanced observers. It's a documented phenomenon."

A prepared response. Thorne had heard variations of it before.

"What's your name, ma'am?"

"Dr. Elaine Winters, NovaCorp Neurological Division." Her chin lifted slightly with the introduction. "And I assure you, Detective, there's nothing wrong with my enhancement."

Thorne noted the division—one of the most prestigious at NovaCorp, responsible for developing next-generation neural interfaces. If anyone would recognize a malfunction, it should be her.

"Are you experiencing any gaps in memory, Dr. Winters? Times when you find yourself in places without remembering how you got there?"

Something flickered across her face—uncertainty, perhaps fear—before her professional mask returned.

"Of course not. That would be reported immediately." She glanced at the scrolling station display. "This is my stop."

It wasn't. They were approaching Westlake, not the Central District where NovaCorp headquarters dominated the skyline.

As the train slowed, she moved toward the doors. Thorne didn't try to stop her, but offered his contact card—an actual piece of cardstock with information printed on it. Another anachronism.

"If you do experience anything unusual, please call me directly."

Dr. Winters glanced at the card but didn't take it.

"There's nothing unusual happening, Detective," she said as the doors opened. "Enhancement technology has been stable for fifteen years."

She stepped onto the platform, moving with the precision of someone completely certain of their destination. As the doors began to close, she turned back toward the train. For just a moment, her pupils dilated again, expanding until her eyes seemed almost black.

"Convergence facilitates evolutionary necessity," she said, her voice oddly flat. Then she blinked, looked momentarily confused, and walked away as the train pulled from the station.

Thorne watched through the window until she disappeared among the morning crowd. He made a note in his actual paper notebook—the third case now of dilated pupils and dissociative behavior followed by memory gaps. All three in individuals with high-level neural interface clearance. All three with no record of malfunction in their enhancement logs.

His communication unit buzzed—the analog phone he carried rather than relying on neural messaging. It was Sarah Chen, his partner. One of the few enhanced officers who still worked with him willingly.

"Thorne," he answered.

"Where are you?" Sarah's voice held a hint of concern. "Captain Beck is looking for you. Something about unauthorized data requests on NovaCorp maintenance patterns."

"I'm heading in now. Just following up on something."

"Another 'glitch' case?" He could hear her skepticism through the connection.

"Maybe." Thorne watched the city blur past the windows. "Have you ever heard an enhanced person use the phrase 'convergence facilitates evolutionary necessity'?"

A pause, longer than normal for Sarah's enhanced cognition speed.

"No," she finally said. "It doesn't match any standard enhancement terminology."

"That's what I thought."

"John," Sarah said, her voice lowered, "Beck isn't the only one looking for you. There are two NovaCorp representatives here. They're asking about your interest in memory gap cases."

Thorne felt a familiar tension settle between his shoulders. "Tell them I'm just being thorough."

"They don't seem interested in thoroughness," Sarah replied. "Be careful coming in."

The call ended. Thorne glanced around the train car at the enhanced passengers, each in their own digital world, unaware of their physical surroundings. How many of them had experienced moments like Dr. Winters? How many had gaps they didn't know about, hidden by enhancement logs that always showed continuous function?

He thought of the case files in his jacket—three incidents now, connected by a pattern only he seemed to notice. Whether it was NovaCorp malfunctions or something else entirely, Thorne intended to find out.

The train continued south, carrying him toward a precinct where he was increasingly unwelcome and a mystery that no one else seemed to see.

# DETECTIVE JOHN THORNE: OUT OF TIME

The 6:15 southbound rattled softly beneath the neon-scarred streets of New Manhattan, rocking commuters gently into the rhythm of another indistinguishable morning. Detective John Thorne stood among them, gripping the worn leather strap above. He held a paper file—an artifact of a past few remembered, let alone respected. Around him, passengers stood transfixed by invisible streams of data, eyes shimmering softly with the spectral blue of neural feeds.

No one saw anyone. No one needed to. Except Thorne.

He noticed her three stops into the ride. Mid-thirties, impeccable suit, posture unnaturally precise amidst the subtle jostle of the carriage. Her enhancement indicator pulsed calmly at her temple, a gentle green, standard, reassuring—except her eyes were off. Pupils pinpricks in the muted subway lighting, her gaze perfectly straight, vacant. Not seeing, not processing. Fixed upon nothing at all.

He'd seen it twice before. Both times, investigations had quietly disappeared beneath bureaucratic red tape and digital assurances that nothing was wrong.

As the brakes hissed at Morris Heights station, her head tilted—exactly five degrees, a mechanical precision. Her grip on the rail slackened. Then suddenly, pupils dilated, irises vanishing into empty black.

No one else reacted. No one else even noticed. Reality, after all, was digital, projected neatly onto the walls of their skulls.

Thorne slipped the file into his coat and stepped closer, casual but alert. Doors opened, closed; the gentle shuffle of oblivious humanity around them faded again into the hum of acceleration.

"Excuse me," Thorne spoke quietly. "Ma'am, are you all right?"

She didn't reply. Her indicator pulsed green—nothing anomalous, everything fine. Thorne knew better.

"I'm Detective Thorne, NMPD," he tried again, softly authoritative. "Are you feeling well?"

The train lurched. She swayed naturally with the rhythm, but her eyes remained static, wide with emptiness. Then, abruptly, she blinked—twice, rapid, startled. Her pupils shrank back, normal again.

"Yes?" She focused on him, mildly irritated. "Can I help you?"

"You seemed," he chose carefully, "disconnected."

She frowned slightly, tapping her indicator. "I'm fine. Just working." As if that explained everything—and perhaps, for everyone else, it did.

"You were completely unresponsive," Thorne pressed, observing carefully. "Approximately ninety seconds. Your pupils dilated fully under direct light."

Her irritation gave way to faint discomfort, quickly masked. "Impossible. My neural logs show continuous activity—" She stopped abruptly, eyes narrowing. "Who are you again?"

He withdrew his badge—heavy, metallic, real—a deliberate inconvenience in a world where digital identity sufficed.

"You're unenhanced." Her voice was cautious, quietly disdainful, pitying even.

"I am."

She nodded, guardedly relaxed. "Neural interfaces can create visual artifacts for unenhanced observers. It's documented."

Prepared and smooth. He'd heard it before, too often.

"Your name?"

She hesitated, then spoke with clinical detachment. "Dr. Elaine Winters, NovaCorp Neurological Division."

He recognized it instantly—NovaCorp's elite, responsible for the neural interfaces woven into the city's very consciousness.

"Memory gaps?" he asked softly. "Unexplained moments or confusion about your location?"

A flicker of something—vulnerability, fear perhaps—then extinguished with practiced ease. "Certainly not. I'd report that immediately." She glanced anxiously at the scrolling display. "This is my stop."

It wasn't. They were nowhere near Central District.

He didn't stop her, instead offering his card—another deliberate anachronism, ink on heavy cardstock. "Contact me if you experience anything strange."

She eyed the card warily but didn't accept. "Nothing strange is happening. Enhancement technology has been stable fifteen years."

The doors hissed open, and she stepped out with controlled, mechanical calm. As the doors began sliding shut, she pivoted suddenly, turning to face him through the window, eyes again fully dilated, empty.

"Convergence facilitates evolutionary necessity," she stated flatly, like reciting code. Then she blinked, confusion fluttering across her face, and turned quickly away into the indifferent city.

Thorne stared after her, a chill tightening his spine. He noted carefully in his battered notebook—three similar episodes now. Dilated pupils, disconnection, subsequent amnesia. Always people with high-level neural clearance. Always pristine digital logs—no records, no traces.

His analog phone buzzed sharply. Sarah Chen, partner, trusted colleague, rare enhanced ally.

"Thorne," he answered curtly.

"Where are you?" Her voice, calm but edged. "Captain Beck's looking for you—unauthorized data requests on NovaCorp logs."

"I'm coming," he said quietly. "Checking something."

Another pause. "Another glitch case?" Skepticism laced her tone.

"Maybe. Ever heard the phrase 'convergence facilitates evolutionary necessity'?"

Silence stretched—a heartbeat longer than normal, a momentary hesitation uncharacteristic for Sarah.

"No," she replied finally. "Not standard terminology."

"I didn't think so."

"John," her voice dropped lower, tight. "Two NovaCorp suits are here. They want to know why you're digging into memory gap cases. Watch yourself."

He felt tension tightening into familiar knots along his shoulders. "Tell them I'm just being thorough."

"They don't seem to value thoroughness," she said carefully. "Watch your back."

The call disconnected abruptly. Thorne glanced at passengers around him, silently staring into the digital void, unaware, unconcerned, trusting utterly in the flawless illusion projected into their minds. How many had experienced moments like Winters, erased neatly from their lives, hidden by clean logs and trusted interfaces?

He felt the weight of the files inside his coat—three cases now, anomalies that refused explanation, evidence of something dark crawling beneath the glittering digital facade. A puzzle everyone else was designed not to notice.

The train shuddered forward, deeper into a city whose illusions were growing thin, toward answers nobody wanted found.

Nobody, except John Thorne.
